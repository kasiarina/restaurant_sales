Klaudia Nadziejewiec,5,"A very atmospheric place with delicious pizza. It's worth booking a table in advance, although we managed to get one without one :) 4 flavored olive oils for pizza for PLN 4, I ran out of truffle oil in such an Italian place, but you can always add it :) tiramisu - poetry. I recommend!",2024-08-05 17:25:49
Monika Bielecka,5,"What a shot at Italian flavors this Sunday! Nicely presented scissors pizza, delicious and crispy dough, high-quality ingredients! Pasta cooked to perfection, simple, tasty and exquisite. For dessert, we were blown away by the Panna Cotta. We haven't eaten better. We will definitely come back. Peace and quiet, homely atmosphere, a cat, a dog in the yard, a nice, cozy garden, a wonderful black table reflecting the crown of a huge tree, giving a pleasant shade. Thank you, it was great! üôè",2024-07-14 18:53:13
